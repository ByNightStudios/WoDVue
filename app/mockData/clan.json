They were devastated by the Tremere until only seven survived, and those gave the gift of the Embrace with extreme rarity, never increasing their numbers, lest the Tremere discover they still survived. In modern nights, they have broken that prohibition against the embrace, and on rare occasion, Salubri healers embrace childer they find to be particularly compassionate or wise. Yet even though they are few, the Salubri Healers continue on their founder’s quest, convinced that one day they will unlock the secrets of Golconda and ascend to the angelic state described in the writings of Saulot. \n\n",

They take contracts and return to Alamut with the spoils of victory when they are successful. The rest of the clan – a signiﬁcant minority – are of the two other castes: the Sorcerers and the Viziers. The Sorcerers remain hidden in the mountain of Alamut, tending to the clan’s powerful leader, a vampire known as the Eldest. The Viziers, once trusted by their clan, defected from the Mountain over an ideological schism, refusing to bow to the will of the Eldest. For that crime, they are hunted by their fellows.

Unlike conventional Lasombra, the Corsairs show little interest in weaving tangled and manipulative shadow webs. Instead, they choose to embrace strife through violence, treachery, and guile as a means to ascension. For the Corsairs, the shadows are not just an entity to master; they are a strategic place to evade pursuit and to strike against their enemies.",

Sealed away by dark and shadowy monsters, those of this bloodline were conscripted in a plot against their parent clan. They spent the centuries being used as feeding stock, shock troops, and eventually spies – all to serve in a war they scarcely understood.

If the stories are true, she is believed to have escaped his clutches to birth the Nosferatu Clan. For her defiance, the other offspring of the founder hunted her, but yet no tangible evidence of these hunters were ever discovered. Over time, these pursuers became little more than ghost stories and boogeymen; myths told to scare ancillae and neonates. To the Creeps, however, these horrific monsters were very real – they were their jailors and known to them only as the “Hungry”.",

Because prey was scarce in the subterranean lairs, to ensure the survival of the Hungry the Creeps were forced to embrace generation after generation in a depraved attempt to cultivate and control a vampire herd from which to feed. These generations never saw the surface world and survived trapped in massive underground cave systems they call the Depths. Many remained in a blood-starved torpor, forgotten and ignored until they were woken to hunt, feed, or to be fed on.

The Crone was ancient and powerful and had noted the progress of civilization as the ages passed. It foresaw that humans, in their greed and recklessness, would eventually destroy and burn all the wild areas of the world. Joining some of her essence with an undying predator of humanity, the Crone resolved to thwart this prophecy. The Witch of Connaught then set out to amass followers who could help prevent this disaster. Her bloodline became the Lhiannan; a group of reclusive protectors of the wild places composed primarily of women. Together, they worked to safeguard the wilds with powerful magics, watching humanity with a wary eye. ",

As time passed, the Lhiannan saw their premonition begin to take shape. They retreated even further into solitude, performing ancient magic that they referred to as “Ogham” to aid them in protecting their lands from interlopers. These magics tied them to their territories but made them powerful foes.

Embattled and at odds with their former brethren, the outcasts fled to Egypt. It was there that they discovered a mysterious creature who promised them the answers to death that they so desperately wanted.

These nights, the newly embraced members of the bloodline often act as agents for older Nagaraja who in turn lead the bloodline to organize and strengthen its position. With few elders left in the clan, many Nagaraja are ignorant as to the truth of their bloodline’s beginnings. They are acutely aware that most, if not all, other vampires consider the Nagaraja a dangerous and vile bloodline of nefarious origin and are aware that their elders are seeking to change that narrative. The elders believe their best way to forge a path forward is to strike an accord with the other necromantic clans and bloodlines. However, they are adamant in their stance against the Followers of Set; a position which makes the Nagaraja a potentially polarizing ally.\n\n\n\n",

The bloodline comes together twice a century to share academic discussions, research, scientific treatises, and philosophical advancements. \n\n",

They use this time to study the sky and seek prophecy. Other Gangrel occasionally seek them out to ask for specific portents, but the Noiad rarely trust visitors to their land. \n\n",

In the end, they were overcome by Lasombra and Ventrue forces wishing a foothold in the New World. The bloodline survived, falling back to the undiscovered depths of South America’s jungles.

Known in the Dark Ages as “Black Angels,” they took the Lasombra penchant for faith and evil ambition to an extreme, claiming to serve satanic purposes. They worshipped sin and fostered true darkness of the soul, doing so in a vicious parody of the Catholic Church.\nThis bloodline was wooed away from its parent clan by a Baali named Azaneal, the ruler of Chorazin. He convinced the Angellis Ater that their adherence to satanism would be best served by allying with the infernal Baali and making their own infernal pacts for power. They quickly consummated their alliance with demonic rites; through sinister purpose and unknown magic, the Angellis Ater transformed their blood and became a lineage of Baali. The Angellis Ater have many subtle and influential contacts in mortal churches, from the spires of Rome to the Pentecostal snake-handlers of the Deep South. \n\n\n",

Ananke believe that the secrets of the universe can be witnessed in a microcosm by scrutinizing the bodies of the recently dead. Wisdom can only be gained by savagely tearing into the corporeal, physically delving through the inner workings of each creature in creation. This means that an Ananke Malkavian often has a low Morality, sacrificing her Humanity to her search for gristly answers.\nAlthough the bloodline is experiencing a resurgence (more promising childer are available, due to the modern fascination with serial killers), by and large the Ananke are few. A member of this bloodline is compelled to collect trophies of her murderous exploits, using Auspex on them in meditative contemplation. She surrounds herself with the visceral “workings of the universe” in an attempt to find deeper understanding. Scholars suspect that one of the first Ananke Malkavians was the Methuselah known as the Ankou. \n\n",

According to the Ishtarri, the Toreador Antediluvian was once worshipped as the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, and their lineage began as a cult dedicated to her adoration. The Ishtarri are consummate dancers, acrobats, and spies, trained in a religion dedicated to immaculate form and movement. Like the goddess Ishtar, they venerate both love and war, and spend their existence perfecting the physical accomplishments of sexuality and combat.\n\n",

These Toreador practice fleshcrafting and other horrible arts, extending their creative endeavors to the dark, cutting edge of reason. Volgirre’s lineage received false names and false histories, and has been allowed to integrate into the Camarilla without the knowledge of the other clans. The Volgirre have the same in-clan disciplines as their parent clan, but their long association with the Tzimisce allows them to purchase the first 2 dots of Vicissitude without a teacher, at out-of-clan XP costs. \n\n",

They studied the myths of the legendary god hero Telyavel, the Lithuanian protector of the dead. These pagan Tremere watched the atrocities performed by the clan through the Dark Ages and began to pull away from the Tremere. In return, the parent clan did not support the Telyav against their enemies, and by the 1600s, the Telyav were nearly extinct. The cabals of the Telyav, preferring animistic magic over the formal hermetic style of their parent clan, sought to escape the strict Tremere hierarchy.\nWhen given the opportunity, they allowed the other Tremere to believe their bloodline had been wiped out, with no survivors to tell the tale. They exist in modern nights, always hiding from the Pyramid, knowing that if other Tremere discover their existence, they will be utterly destroyed. Members of this bloodline are found almost entirely among the Sabbat. \n\n",

Their magic is drawn from the land, from otherworldly lines of energy that criss-cross the earth in mystic patterns. The Koldun twist those energies as ruthlessly as others in their clan twist flesh. Koldunism is an ancient skill, and a demanding one. Tzimisce who learn sorcery do not do so purely because their sire had the talent. They must prove that they have an aptitude for rigorous control, and for bargaining with the spirits and enslaving them to the Tzimisce’s desire. Those who try and fail always die, incinerated by the very power they wanted to command.\nYou can purchase Thaumaturgy: Path of Elemental Mastery and one other Thaumaturgical path of your choice. This additional path of Thaumaturgy can be learned without a teacher and is purchased at in-clan costs, but is not considered an in-clan discipline. For example, when using the Dominate power Possession, this additional path is not considered in-clan and cannot be brought along.\n\n",

These cruel vampires are more soldier than prince, resembling last-born noble sons thrust into war and bloodshed in order to earn a place at the royal table. The Crusaders are prone to cruelty, and are excellent trackers, able to locate even the most elusive of prey. Despite Ventrue unease about this bloodline’s tendency toward sadism, Crusaders are Kings to the core, with all the egotistical pride of their parent clan. They are simply prone to a more visceral enjoyment of their victories; they prefer to look into an enemy’s eyes the moment she turns to ash. Crusaders are somewhat infamous because they enjoy acts of cruelty and viciousness. \n\n",

It is their hope that with support, guidance, and a rigid system to provide structure, the clan can thrive again.\n\n",

Older Ravnos tend to hail from the Brahman Hindi caste, remembering a time when the Ravnos were more caste-based than they are in the modern era. The two groups often bicker over the clan’s future, as the youthful Ravnos struggle to ﬁnd their own place in the world. The older Ravnos are wiser, stronger in blood, and more practiced — but the new surge of young vampires brings fresh ideas, technological experience, and a great deal of energy and change. The clan stands on a precipice between respecting the traditional ways and embracing new ones, between ancient truths and too-fast lies. The Ravnos must ﬁnd balance, or be forever changed.\r\n",

Only in the Sabbat have the Setites turned their back on their Antediluvian, advocating the worship of Caine and denying Set’s divinity.\r\nUnfortunately, such fanatic dedication makes enemies. Other clans consider the Followers of Set little better than infernalists selling their souls to an unknown entity. Certainly, Setites specialize in offering devil’s deals, but they nearly always uphold their side of the bargain.

Typically, these childer are ﬁrst brought into the worship of Set, and then given the Embrace as a dark gift in the service of their god.

Whether these devotees are fanatic slaves, adoring followers, or sex-crazed groupies, your cult serves without question. These mortals adore their vampiric master — whether or not they know your true nature. You may define this cult in any way you choose. Perhaps they worship Set, or Caine, or even you. They may have ecstatic parties and orgies, run drug laboratories, or participate in any rituals you choose.\n\nYou gain 5 free dots in one of the following backgrounds: Haven, Herd, or Resources. If you’ve previously purchased dots of that background, all XP is refunded. If you assigned creation points to that background, you may move those points to another background in which you currently have no points.\n\nIn addition to this background, you have a temple in which your personal cult worships; this temple is considered holy ground. If you have any merits or flaws that are affected by holy ground, this temple does not affect you negatively. If you spend 3 Blood and rest the day in this temple, you can heal 2 points of aggravated damage instead of 1. This temple may be further defined by the Haven merit.\n\n",

You must assign 4 dots to one background, 3 dots to the next, and 2 dots to the final background.\n\nThese dots do not require you to expend XP to purchase. If you previously purchased dots in an applicable background, the XP is refunded. If you assigned dots during character creation to an applicable background, you can move those dots to another background in which you currently have no points.\n\nIn addition, the life of luxury you live allows you to surround yourself with the best material goods, from your clothes to your electronics. You can add either the Antique, Artisan, Flashy, or Stylish qualities to any miscellaneous gear you possess without additional difficulty or cost. Adding a quality to an item in this way does not count toward the maximum number of qualities that a piece of equipment can possess. \n\n\n\n",

The Viziers, however, have been aware of this possibility for centuries, and they are capable of using it to great effect. You’ve experimented and studied for years, and you’ve mastered the art of distilling blood to extract its donor’s essence. By binding a portion of her knowledge, you can brew a potion capable of imparting her skills to others. First, you must collect 1 point of your target’s Blood. If you spend a standard action to examine it, you determine if your target possesses any skills at 4 dots or greater, and if so, which skills those are. This ability does not give you the exact score for each skill; it only tells you which skills are 4 dots or greater.\n\nTo brew the potion, spend 1 downtime action and choose a skill identified in the previous step to distill from the blood and create into a potion. This process wholly consumes the point of Blood. Create an item record to represent the potion, noting the skill chosen. Drinking the potion takes a simple action. After consuming it, for the next 10 minutes, or for the next two turns if combat takes place, you receive a +2 wild card bonus to the skill chosen when the potion was created.\n\nYou may only benefit from the use of one of these potions at a time, and you cannot benefit from a potion made of your own Blood. Drinking a potion counts as drinking the blood of the original donor for the purpose of establishing blood bonds, etc. You may only have as many potions in existence as you have dots of the Occult skill. Potions remain virile for three months before they become inert. \n\n",

This bonus applies to all pools except defense pools.\n\nAdditionally, the spirits teach you ancient knowledge and share long-lost tales. You gain 2 free dots of the Lore skill (including specializations as per purchasing dots of that skill), and your maximum level of the Lore skill is increased by 2. If you’ve previously spent XP on the first 2 dots of the Lore skill, that XP is refunded.

Its transitory nature makes its existence all the sweeter. You are able to instill your art with your very essence, doubling the dots you possess of your Crafts skill, when you are specialized in the area of expertise relevant to the art you create. Such pieces must be wholly created by you, such as a painting, a piece of fine jewelry, a statue, or other item. Only three of these items may exist at a time, and that maximum cannot be exceeded. You may gift these items to another creature, but your creative limit remains, even if you no longer possess the artworks. You cannot create another item unless less than three of your art pieces exist.\n\nPieces created via Ephemeral Rhapsody are so imbued with the essence of life that vampires may feed from them. Treat the artworks as though they contain 5 points of mortal Blood. This Blood may be drained in part or in whole, consumed at the normal rate at which you typically drink Blood. In most cases, such as with a statue or painting, this act involves physically biting into and “drinking” its essence, however, in cases where this action doesn’t make sense, you may instead destroy the item, ravaging it for its creative essence. In either case, you may bite into and consume the Blood in these items by expending a simple action. The act of doing so effectively destroys the item, robbing it of its beauty, craft rating, and soul. Any who view such a piece see it as a violated work, one that was once truly spectacular.\n\n",

You occasionally remember things that didn’t happen or have alternate-timeline impressions of people you know. This gives you a distorted perception of the world, but it can be useful when your life is in danger. You side-step blows before they are thrown; you move out of the radius of explosions, or away from falling objects, before they strike. Even Mental and Social powers have a difficult time invading your mind, as you are fortified within these strange ripples of insanity. \n\nOnce per game session, when you are called upon to resist a Physical, Mental, or Social challenge, or when you are required to make a test that could result in injury, you may spend 1 Blood to automatically win the challenge or avoid the situation entirely. Sophistry can be invoked at any time, even before your turn in the initiative order. When Sophistry is used to avoid an attack, your opponent is considered to have failed to affect you. In the case of Mental and Social challenges, this result may prevent you from being immediately targeted again by the same power.

While other Toreador focus on their paintings or their voices, your talents are a little more grotesque. When using your Crafts skill test pool, you may incorporate your Vicissitude powers to create objects that are shockingly and disturbingly alive. These objects are fully functional and are imbued with a horrifying biological capability. For example, a book may have a mouth and the ability to read itself to you, a harp may have arms to pluck itself, or a piece of furniture may have moving legs to arrange itself when commanded.\n\nTo use this merit, declare your intent to use it to the Storyteller and select a single function to imbue into a crafted item. Using this merit causes you to enter the next game session with a number of Beast traits appropriate to killing an animal or human donor, subject to any modifiers, such as those granted by Morality merits. In most cases, a human donor is required to craft an item using Visceral Artisan, but some simple functions can be accomplished with animal components. Donor specimens cannot be supernatural creatures other than ghouls; the physiology of supernatural creatures simply does not work with your\nmethods.\n\nOnce you have gathered sufficient materials, make a static challenge using your Crafts skill test pool against the difficulty of the object you’re creating. If you succeed, the object takes on the intended characteristic. If you fail, the Storyteller determines if you must either start again, or if the object is created, but with a darker functionality or consequence.\n\nObjects created in using Visceral Artisan require some trivial degree of maintenance, such as feeding it an occasional bit of raw meat; these objects do not require any downtime actions to maintain. If fed your Blood, they survive indefinitely, and they can be subjected to the blood bond. However, if these objects are abandoned, not cared for, or lack the functionality to feed themselves, they will die. These objects are undeniable breeches of the Masquerade and are typically hidden away, even when lovingly cherished by their owners.\n\n\n\n",

This penalty is cumulative, so if an Anda has slept three days within five miles of the same area she had previously slept, she must spend 4 points of Blood to wake (the standard 1 point + 3 additional points for the three days spent sleeping within five miles of the same area). This count resets once she sleeps a single day more than five miles from where she slept the day before. If she cannot spend enough Blood to reawaken, she falls into torpor. She will remain in torpor for a number of weeks equal to the number of days she spent sleeping in the same area, after which she may spend 1 point of Blood to reawaken.",

Just as a snake infrequently sheds its skin, you are likewise limited to using this power only once per game session, and afterwards your maximum Willpower pool is reduced by 1 for 30 days or two game sessions, whichever is shorter. \n\n\n\n",

If you look into the Umbra, you can see any spirits nearby, including the presence of any werewolves currently within the Umbra in the area.

For each dot of the Occult skill you possess, you can ask for their assistance once per game session. As you call upon the Loa, they seize control of your body, and they guide your actions. For one turn, you may choose one skill and increase its value to 5 dots. This ability may be used at any time, even before your turn in the initiative order, but not once a challenge that you are participating in has begun. You cannot summon the Loa more than once per turn, and this ability cannot benefit any actions that take longer than one turn to complete. Skills increased by this ability do not gain specializations or areas of focus. For example, you may use this background to temporarily increase your Lore skill, but it will not grant you additional Lore skill specializations. You can purchase this merit along with the Giovanni merit: Necromantic Expertise. This is an exception to the rule preventing you from purchasing more than one clan-specific merit of the same cost. \n\n",

These bonuses do not stack; if more than one bonus applies, you receive the greater bonus. \n\nRighteous Fury requires a conscious act of faith, you must declare that you are using Righteous Fury when you announce the target of your character’s attack. If that target doesn’t meet the qualifications, this merit provides no bonus. All characters are aware of a successful use of this merit; brilliant white light erupts from the Salubri’s fist (or weapon), radiating through the blow with the terrifying radiance of faith. Vampires who see this effect may not recognize it, but they feel a perceptible fear wash over them at the sight. This light does nothing to reduce the Salubri’s reputation as an infernalist; on the contrary, faith could evince from any number of sources — including evil ones. The successful use of this power does not differentiate, so it is not possible to tell what aspect of the target (diablerist, demonist, Tremere or all of the above) has triggered Righteous Fury’s effect. \n\n",

To do so, you must start with one of your Retainers. As it becomes a Vozhd, it gains 3 bonus levels of Stock NPC rating in addition to its current levels. These bonus ratings do not affect the XP cost to further increase the Retainer’s level. You may then give it one Animal Retainer trait. It also gains 2 Physical attribute focuses: an exception to the rule preventing Stock NPCs from having Physical attribute focuses. Lastly, it grows one size category for every 3 levels of NPC rating it possesses, up to a maximum of Delta. This merit can be combined with other merits or disciplines for ghouls, but you can only make one Vozhd every six game sessions or three months, whichever is shorter, due to the difficulty of gathering components and growing specimens. Creating a Vozhd requires you to expend 1 downtime action per level of the Retainer at the time of its transformation.\n\n",

At the beginning of each game session, inform the Storyteller how many downtime actions you reserved. Anytime you encounter a scenario where you would have benefited from previously spending a downtime action, you can do so at that moment, retroactively recalling that you previously already took care of what you needed\nbecause of a hunch.\n\nThis merit allows you to do anything that would normally take place in a downtime action. For example, you might have suddenly decided to patrol Elysium grounds, investigate the activity at a church, or sculpted a masterpiece. Once a downtime action is spent via Method to the Madness, treat it like a normal downtime action; it may be traced, tracked, or otherwise observed as per normal.\n\n",

By spending three standard actions studying a murder scene, you may utilize a special Tracking ability to hunt and pursue the killer (or killers) without the requirement of Heightened Senses, the abilities of Shape of the Beast, or the need to sniff or track by scent. Your skill in tracking killers is innate and involves a complex and a supernatural affinity akin to forensic science. To track a target murderer, you may employ your Mental attribute + Occult skill instead of the normal Mental attribute + Survival skill for any tracking challenges. You may utilize this specialized tracking skill only against the murderer or murderers of your discovered crime scene. Unlike normal tracking challenges, you are not limited to tracking killers travelling by foot and do not lose the trail if your target crosses water or gets into a vehicle, nor can your target utilize the Streetwise skill to evade pursuit. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of whether or not a character can be tracked by your knowledge of forensics. ",

This immunity includes any damage converted to aggravated damage, such as through the power Baal’s Caress; such damage is instead inflicted as normal damage. In addition, you take no bonus damage from effects such as those conveyed by the power Baal’s Bloody Talons, and the traits granted by that power do not apply when used against you.\n\nWith difficulty, you may also expel other supernatural poisons from yourself. If you are affected by a supernatural poison such as that conveyed by the powers The Slow Knife or Blur of the Weeping Eye, you can spend one simple action and 1 point of Blood per supernatural poison to expel them, vomiting them in an inert pool of blood. \n\n",

Whether part of a spiritual tradition, a secular one such as psychotherapy, or simply by being a repository of good advice, you are able to help others unburden themselves of their spiritual weight.\n\nBy spending at least 10 minutes in discussion, you can cause a character’s Beast traits to reduce by 2, provided she gives you an honest account of what she did to incur them. If you possess the Animal Ken skill, you can use it to remove a third Beast trait, as per the standard ability of the Animal Ken skill. In addition, having heard her confession, you may offer centering and guidance to the target character. If you do, the next time the recipient would incur a Beast trait, she incurs 1 fewer trait. A character may only benefit from a single application of this ability once per game session.\nYou cannot use this ability on yourself.\n\n\n\n",

You’ve become especially adept at aiding them while still blending in and maintaining the Masquerade. Whenever you use an Obeah power for the benefit or defense of a non-supernatural mortal, the target automatically assumes you are a lesser figure associated with whatever religion the target practices, and she keeps your actions and existence secret. In the case of secular or atheistic witnesses, they acknowledge you (perhaps grudgingly) as a benign supernatural creature or perhaps as an extraordinary human with psychic powers, preserving the Masquerade as well.\n\nThis benefit does not apply if targets witness you acting to harm another character, excepting circumstances when you are obviously acting in someone’s defense. In addition, you have built up goodwill to the point that your community not only keeps your secrets, but also actively assists you above and beyond expectations. Each game session, the first time you use your Contacts and Allies backgrounds, you do not expend them, allowing you to use them again. You may also seek refuge in your community by spending a downtime action to gain the temporary use of the Haven background. Treat this background as though it had a 1-dot rating, with the Location advantage. This haven lasts until the next game session.\n\n",

If at any time you do not have access to your spell components, you must spend 1 point of Willpower to use Thaumaturgy. If you do, you may use Thaumaturgy for the next hour. You are free to invent your own ingredients and mixology as appropriate. Using spell components during combat does not require additional actions. ",

With this knowledge, you have potent power over the dead, allowing you to raise an especially powerful zombie Retainer. This zombie is created using rules for the Shambling Hordes power (see MET: VTM: Chapter Four: Disciplines: Necromancy, The Bone Path, Shambling Hordes). However, this\nservant becomes a 5-dot Retainer. This Retainer has your choice of either the Fortitude or Obfuscate specialization. Create it as a rating 5 Stock NPC (see MET: VTM, Chapter Three:\nCharacter Creation: Background Descriptions, Retainers). Unlike most zombies, your Retainer is an intelligent creature that can assist you with downtime actions, when appropriate. You may only have one of these Retainers at a single time. If your zombie Retainer is lost, destroyed, or no longer desired, you may spend 1 downtime action to create a new zombie Retainer, at which point, the previous Retainer reverts to a normal zombie. In addition, your understanding of death allows you to gather and maintain a healthy supply of bodies for your necromantic rituals, with one always at your disposal if needed\n\n\n\n",

This permission typically requires some act of service for your totem or implementing its teachings in a meaningful way.\n\nThis totem grants benefits nearly identical to a shapeshifter’s totem benefits, with some\nexceptions. Any totem benefits that cost or provide Gnosis instead cost or provide the same quantity of Blood points. Should you purchase more than 2 dots of Totem background, you are exempted from the Pack Diversity requirement, allowing you to receive more than 2 totem bonuses. In addition, the Gift Affinity totem benefit instead grants you a single use of a 1-dot power from one of the following disciplines: Auspex, Animalism, Dominate, Obfuscate, Presence, Thaumaturgy, or Spiritus.\n\n",

In addition, you may choose to double the duration of any Path of Elemental Mastery power. Lastly, any spirits you summon or objects you animate receive a +2 bonus to their Stock NPC rating.\n\nEven if you do not yet have the ability to summon spirits with Path of Elemental Mastery, you can still summon a simple spirit by spending 1 point of Blood and using a standard action to do so.

Sealed away by dark and shadowy monsters, those of this bloodline were conscripted in a plot against their parent clan. They spent the centuries being used as feeding stock, shock troops, and eventually spies – all to serve in a war they scarcely understood. The recent liberation of one of their warrens by a coterie of Nosferatu has changed the bloodline’s fortunes. The Nosferatu now recognize them as victims of their age-old enemies.

If the stories are true, she is believed to have escaped his clutches to birth the Nosferatu Clan.

Because prey was scarce in the subterranean lairs, to ensure the survival of the Hungry the Creeps were forced to embrace generation after generation in a depraved attempt to cultivate and control a vampire herd from which to feed. These generations never saw the surface world and survived trapped in massive underground cave systems they call the Depths. Many remained in a blood-starved torpor, forgotten and ignored until they were woken to hunt, feed, or to be fed on.

Physical attacks do not prevent the character from fair escaping, unless the attack successfully does damage or unless the Ravnos is grappled. Characters who are physically restrained or imprisoned (not grappled) may study their surroundings for three turns, after which they find a way to escape their bonds. This merit only affects the Ravnos and does not allow the Ravnos to escape from a situation with no logical exit, to escape mental restraints like Dominate, or to move through solid objects.\n\n\n\n",

Only you may ride this steed; it will not abide another rider.\nIn addition, while in this form, your heightened connection to the avatar of death allows you to use any Mortis Path powers without expending Blood points to fuel them \n",

This is particularly annoying to your peers and your loquaciousness can make you an unpaid source of facts and information. Unless you spend a Willpower, you find it impossible to hold back information on a subject you are being directly questioned about. If you spend a point of Willpower in this way, you can refrain from offering your expertise for 10 minutes.

Spend a simple action to spread at least 1 point of your target’s Blood over your face and hands while reciting ancient invocations. This action expends the point of Blood, rendering it inert for all other subsequent uses. Afterward, you receive a +2 wild card bonus to all Physical, Social, and Mental attack test pools against that target for the remainder of the game session. The blood must be visible on your person to use this advantage; if you conceal the blood in any way, such as with Obfuscate, a mask, or gloves, or if the blood is deliberately washed off, the effects of Blood Knows the Way immediately end. As part of this merit’s power, your target will immediately recognize that her blood is upon your body when seeing you.\n\n",

You may use a standard action to sniff the air. If you do so, you can detect any open wounds within your line of sight. If you are underwater, you may use this ability at a range of up to 1 mile. If you use this ability in conjunction with the Auspex discipline power Heightened Senses, you can extend Blood in the Water’s range to 1 mile on land and to 10 miles underwater. \n\nIf you have identified a source of blood, you may attempt a tracking challenge to find its source. Should you identify multiple sources with open wounds, you gain a vague sense of distance and direction for each, and you may choose which one to pursue. Blood in the Water does not convey an ability to know the identity of a target; you are only aware of the presence of open wounds. \n\nMechanically, a character is considered to have open wounds if she has 1 or more points of damage in her wound track that was gained within the past hour. Should you attempt a damage-dealing attack against a target with an open wound, you gain the Brutal and Deadly melee weapon equipment qualities. These qualities apply to any attack that deals damage, including Physical attacks or damaging powers, such as Psychic Assault. Note that Blood in the Water does not grant an exception to the rule preventing you from benefiting from the same equipment quality twice.\n\n",

Provided you are able to use Willpower to retest an opposed Social challenge when resisting one of these effects, you can do so without paying the required Willpower cost. This ability does not provide an exception to the rule that only one Willpower retest may be made per challenge.\n\nIn addition, whenever you use the Assist Attacker or Assist Defender mass combat tactic to support another individual, she gains the benefit of Iron Heart as well for the remainder of the turn, but she cannot share the benefits of Iron Heart with others. You can use the Assist Defender tactic solely to give someone this benefit in response to another character’s use of a Social or Mental power against them, though you cannot use the Assist Defender tactic to intercept the power or become its target.\n\n\n\n\n",

Even those who place no stock in the occult carry images of saints or good luck charms. You have the skill necessary to create a talisman, an object that contains a level 1 or level 2 Thaumaturgy ritual. Using this power, you can imbue a part of your magic into a small trinket, such as a crystal or stone, a small stone or wood carving, or a small pouch of herbs. To create one, spend one downtime action (in addition to any other cost and/or requirement for the target ritual) casting the ritual and 1 point of Blood to infuse the item with the ritual. The Storyteller then creates a record noting the item, the ritual, and its expiration, as well as your test pool to be used, if applicable to the ritual.\n\nTo use the talisman, its bearer spends a simple action to activate its magic. The user does not need to know the ritual to activate the talisman, but the user must interact with the talisman in a meaningful way, such as by consuming the herbs or saying a special prayer. In all cases, using the talisman requires you to expend one simple action to activate it. You can only benefit from the effects of a single talisman at a given time, and you cannot benefit from the same ritual twice, if you use a talisman to activate that ritual. You can have as many of these talismans in existence as you possess in dots of your Occult skill, and they remain virile for three months before they become inert. \n\n",

In addition, should you choose to have your creations appear with weapons, you may assign two weapon equipment qualities to each. Whenever you command these illusions to attack via the Chimerstry power Horrid Reality, you may choose to use the bonuses from those weapon equipment qualities as part of your attack. For example, if you create an illusionary guard bearing a rifle with the Accurate and Ranged equipment qualities, you may add the +2 wild card bonus from the Accurate quality to your Horrid Reality test pool, and you may also target defenders at an extended\nrange, as per the Ranged equipment quality rules.\n\n\n\n",

Once the Judgement Woad is enacted, you maintain  familiarity with your chosen target until you enact a new Woad. In addition, twice per game session you may utilize a free retest against a power that your chosen enemy attempts to use on you. These retests can be used in addition to any other appropriate retests, such as Willpower, but only one retest can be used in a single challenge.

When doing so, you remain in a humanoid shape, but with an animal head, much like the way Egyptians depicted their gods. Your body sprouts sleek, black fur, your nose extends to a curved, fanged snout, and your ears extend like those of a jackal. Your eyes and tongue remain decidedly serpentine. Whenever you utilize the Serpentis power Form of the Cobra, you may instead opt to take the form of the Typhonic Beast instead of a serpent. In this form, you receive the benefits of Form of the Cobra and Skin of the Adder simultaneously, and you may use Tongue of the Serpent freely in this form. None of these powers can be further activated for additional bonuses.\n\nIn addition, whenever you use a Serpentis power in this form, you can benefit from that power’s attribute focus, even if you do not normally possess it.  Typhonic Beast is a major transformation and cannot be combined with other major transformations, except for Divine Image. Activating Divine Image while in the form of the Typhonic Beast is an exception to the rule that prevents you from combining transformative powers. You can end this transformation at any time by expending a simple action. Typhonic Beast’s transformation is close to human, allowing you to use weapons while in this form.\n\n\n\n",

In addition, when contacted with extreme force you lose much larger chunks of yourself. Any time you take 3 or more damage from a physical attack (before Fortitude) you automatically lose 1 point of Blood as you reflexively spend it to keep yourself in one piece.

When you create art or undertake a performance, you can choose one appropriate emotion or state of thought to be reflected in that endeavour. Anyone viewing the art or observing the performance feels that emotion. If an individual wishes to take an action that runs contrary to the chosen emotion, such as attacking someone in the presence of a painting that invokes calm, she may spend 1 Willpower. If she does so, she ignores all Absent Sway effects for the next hour.\n\nThe effects of Absent Sway are passive, not aggressive, and encourage observers to feel emotion or enter a certain state of mind. The emotion encouraged by the art is felt by the victim, but Absent Sway does not force the victim to act in any specific manner. You might paint a picture that provokes viewers to feel the emotion “anger.” The manner in which the individual responds to feeling anger is up to the player of that character. However, if the character wishes to act in some manner that is diametrically opposed or contradictory to the emotion encouraged by the Absent Sway, she must spend 1 Willpower. For example, if she was in the presence of the painting that evoked “anger,” she would not have to punch the person beside her, but she would be forced to spend a point of Willpower if she wanted to start peace negotiations, or announce she has forgiven her enemies for\ntheir past slights.\n\nAbsent Sway cannot affect individuals in combat and has no effect once combat starts, but the power can make it difficult for characters to start combat in the first place. Absent Sway only functions when placed on art that is of significant size or easy to observe. Only characters who can plainly see the art or performance are affected by Absent Sway. A character does not have to spend a point of Willpower to overcome Absent Sway if acting upon the emotion caused by the art would cause the character harm or prevent the character from acting in self-preservation. \n\n",

Whereas most of your clanmates merely perceive this link as nonsensical cacophonic babble, you’ve learned to locate specific information — a mental needle in the chaotic haystack — but finding it comes at a price. If you pause to concentrate, doing nothing else for five turns, you can project your consciousness through this network to seek specific information or lore that another Malkavian knows.\n\nYou can ask questions like:\n•\t Is the vampire in front of me a Malkavian?\n•\t How many Malkavians are there in the city? (The total you receive includes both Malkavians and Malkavian bloodlines.)\n•\t You can ask a question that is typically covered by an Academics, Science, or Lore skill specialization, and receive a short answer.\n\nYou can’t learn personal information like the location of someone’s haven, or who murdered\nthe Prince. However, you can glean information about a specific blood magic ritual, learn the general history of the Camarilla, or uncover anything that is answerable by a Lore skill specialization. Once you do so, for the remainder of the game session, you gain a new derangement selected by the Storyteller to represent touching the heart of madness. Alternatively, you can spend one standard action to broadcast a single five-sentence message to the Malkavian Madness Network or create a special beacon flagging a location as a special place of interest. Any Malkavian, including associated bloodlines, can perceive such messages or beacons, even if they lack this merit. This merit can only be used up to three times\nduring a single game session.\n\n\n\n",

Their ideology, they maintain, is more than simple rebellion; they believe that anything that can burn should, and that which is worthwhile will survive. Your rage can burn through the structures of power others hide behind, shaking your opponent to her core. Whenever you achieve an exceptional success in a Physical attack, you can tear down one of your target’s active powers. Select a power. All instances of that power immediately cease, as if your target had ended it herself. The target can reactivate that power again on her next action, if she chooses. You cannot select any of the following powers when activating Fervent Iconoclast: any power that is considered a transformative power (either major or minor transformations) or any of the powers within Celerity, Potence, Fortitude, or Fleshcraft.\n\nWhen choosing a power, you select a single power within a discipline (or blood magic path, etc.) but not all powers within a discipline. You don’t need to know the power’s name, but you must be somewhat aware of its effects in order to target that power with Fervent Iconoclast. For example, you can end the effects of Mask of Thousand Faces (or a similar disguise power) only if you suspect the target has such a power active. You can only cease the effects of disciplines in this way; rituals, merits, and other sources of power are not affected.\n\n\n\n",

Freed of mundane limitations, you wield your powers more effectively, targeting your foes’ consciousness, rather than simply their senses.\n\nYou are always considered to have a character’s Gaze and Focus, unless that character possesses a power that limits or prevents you from attaining it. If so, determine Gaze and Focus normally, as though neither character had a power affecting Gaze and Focus. In addition, whenever you use a Chimerstry or Auspex power (including techniques that use either of these disciplines) to target another character, that attack does not count against the maximum number of attacks that character can receive during that round of combat.\n\nFor example, if you targeted a character with a Chimerstry power, which would normally prevent that target from receiving another Social attack, that character can still be targeted by an additional Social attack during that round. A target can only be affected by one application of Pierce the Veil in a given round. For example, if two Brahman Ravnos possess this merit, the first Brahman may use Pierce the Veil to make a Chimerstry Social attack against a target, allowing the second Brahman to target that same character with another Chimerstry Social attack, but the second Brahman’s attack counts against the maximum number of Social attacks the target can receive that round.\n\nYou may also use Pierce the Veil to target a character who normally could not be targeted due to having reached the maximum number of attacks possible in that round. For example, if another a character targets your intended target with a Social attack using the Presence discipline prior to your initiative in a given round, you could still use Pierce the Veil to attempt a Chimerstry Social attack on the same target.\n\n\n \n\n",
