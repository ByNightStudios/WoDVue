Spend a point of Blood and your standard action to initiate the bond, targeting either a visible wraith or one you have imprisoned in a Dark Vessel or Deathly Device. If the wraith is unwilling, you must succeed in an opposed challenge. If you succeed, the wraith possesses your body rendering any Dark Vessel or Deathly Device it previously possessed inert, and you may choose one of the wraith’s discipline specializations (if the wraith does not have additional discipline specializations, all wraiths have access to the first 2 dots of Dementation). You may utilize any level of the chosen discipline specialization for the next hour, after which the power ends and the wraith is freed. You must still adhere to any restrictions or conditions of that power, such as requiring Gaze and Focus when using Dread Gaze and cannot use it during Celerity rounds. Both you and the wraith must pay any costs in Blood and Pathos associated with the power. If one of you is unable to spend Blood or Pathos, you cannot use the power.",

If you succeed, your targets become marked by the spirits of the hunt. Those marked immediately lose the ability to communicate, which includes the ability to speak or produce sound, send text messages, or use sign language, and any telepathic links they are a part of immediately sever. They cannot initiate or relent to Telepathy or similar powers of communication for as long as this power is in effect. Further, they cannot benefit from any beneficial powers from others, such as Cloak the Gathering, Corpore Sano, or Madrigal, and may only use their own powers until they have successfully fled the area. In addition, your opponents are unable to be targeted by the Assist Defender or Assist Attacker mass combat tactics.

Further, a light wind in the area carries whispers, warnings, curses, screams, and laughter of the dead. All mortals within the area must leave, and they refuse to enter the area again for the rest of the night. Mortals who are forced to remain suffer a -5 penalty to all test pools.\r\n",

To those who do not condescend to associate with the clanless, it is mere superstition; the fabric of excuses spun by inept Scourges who failed to apprehend their quarry.
