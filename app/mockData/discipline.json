The shadow will immediately strike her for 2 points of normal damage. The attacking shadow does not count toward the maximum number of physical attackers per round. On successive turns, you may spend simple actions during the everyman round to cause the target’s shadow to strike her again, causing an additional 2 points of damage for each simple action spent this way. If multiple simple actions are spent in a single round to cause the shadow to attack, the combined damage is considered a single source for the purposes of damage reduction. The effects of this power end after you have spent 3 simple actions in this way, or once 10 minutes have passed. Your target’s shadow can only attack the target herself and cannot be used to attack other characters.",

If your target has a limited number of items they can control based on the targeted skill, such as Digital Sentries or other items created or controlled by blood magic or blood magic rituals, these items are rendered inert until the duration of Fiddlesticks expires. If less than all the items would be rendered inert, the creator of the items chooses which items are rendered inert.  In addition, your victim cannot achieve an exceptional success in test pools involving the chosen skill.
