Due to this, the undead have lost their dharma and have no true destiny. Those vampires who ignore their dharma must be educated and enlightened — or destroyed.

A Seeker eliminates gender and physical boundaries first, and then works to revise personal mental and social constraints until it is no longer recognizably human by any comparison.

Nearly all supernatural creatures fear and hate infernalists and will kill characters with Infernal Power without question or remorse. Additionally, if you fail to obey your demonic master’s orders or displease the demon, you immediately lose access to this merit. Further, you take 5 points of aggravated damage, which cannot be reduced or negated by any means, for your failure to obey.\n\nThis does not free you from the infernal compact; it is only an expression of your master’s wrath. To regain the use of this merit, you must fulfill a task assigned by your infernal master: one that is always cruel, inhumane, and vile. If you fail to complete that task within 30 days, you meet Final Death. There is no escaping this fate.\n\nCharacters with Infernal Power must choose one of the following infernal gifts. Each infernal gift has two effects, one minor and one major. When you choose a gift, you gain access to both effects provided by that gift.\n\n• Gift: Demonic Fire\n› Minor Effect: Your Infernal Power grants you resistance to fire. Flaming weapons or incendiary weapons inflict normal damage instead of aggravated damage. Additionally, by expending a simple action (and no need for kindling or other fuel), you can create a small ball of greenish-black flame in the palm of your hand. This flame is approximately the size of a baseball. While holding demonic fire, your hand-to-hand attacks cause aggravated damage.\n› Major Effect: By expending a simple action, you can sheath your body in an aura of greenish-black flame for the next five minutes. You can end this effect at any time prior to the end of its duration by expending another simple action. While you are within this aura, your clothing and equipment are not damaged by fire and your Brawl and Melee attacks inflict aggravated damage. Anyone foolish enough to Grapple you, or who is grappling you when you activate this effect, takes 3 points of aggravated damage.\n\n• Gift: Profane Contract\n› Minor Effect: You are authorized by your demonic master to forge lesser contracts, offering another character infernal power in exchange for a portion of her immortal soul. The target of this effect cannot be forced into the bargain through supernatural powers or threats of violence, although she may be coerced through politics, general persuasion, treachery, or other social maneuvers. When she signs the contract, you become her infernal master, and she becomes your infernal servitor. The target gains access to her choice of one minor infernal effect, without needing to purchase the Infernal Power merit. The demon that bestows the infernal pact upon you gains power over any soul who willingly accepts an infernal contract from you. Your demonic master can rescind power from either of you, if it desires. \nIf your servitor disobeys or displeases you, you have the option to punish her by inflicting 5 points of aggravated damage, which cannot be reduced or negated by any means. You may also choose to strip the target’s infernal power and to require that she perform a dark task in order to regain the power. You must assign a task that is possible to achieve, but it can be as difficult or easy as you desire. If the target doesn’t complete your task within 30 days, she\nmeets Final Death. As with any infernal bargain, a lesser contract can only be negated if the target dies, or if you die. If you temporarily lose access to your Infernal Power merit, you cannot use any of these effects against your servitor, nor can you create new contracts. However, your underlings do not lose their powers simply because yours are in abeyance.\n› Major Effect: As long as you maintain at least one Profane Contract with another player-character, you may call upon your Infernal Power, step through the fires of hell, and appear at a place on the physical realm that is sacred to your demonic master, such as a diabolic temple or your infernal altar. To do so, you must concentrate for three full turns while chanting in an infernal language. When you appear at your chosen site, you may choose to spend one minute there and then return to the location you just left. Or, you may choose to remain at the place where you have traveled. You can use this effect once per game for each lesser contract you currently hold.\n\n• Gift: Unholy Regeneration\n› Minor Effect: If you have any damage in your Incapacitated wound track, you automatically regenerate 1 point of normal damage per turn without spending Blood. If you have no remaining normal damage, but still have aggravated damage in your Incapacitated wound track, you heal 1 point of aggravated damage every three turns. This merit heals a character on the her initiative during the everyman round; this power has no effect during Celerity rounds. This merit ceases to function if the character has no wounds in the Incapacitated wound track. Healing provided by this merit doesn’t require an action or an expenditure of Blood.\n› Major Effect: If you are damaged to the point of torpor or Final Death, you immediately resurrect in a blast of greenish-black flame. You resurrect at full health. For the next five turns, you receive a +5 wild card bonus to all defensive test pools. Before the end of that time, you must kill another character and verbally condemn your victim’s soul into your master’s power. If you fail to achieve this goal in the allotted time, you meet your Final Death permanently and irrevocably, regardless of health or any other supernatural power. You cannot use this effect if your infernal master is the one who damaged you to the point of torpor or Final Death, or if your initial death resulted from something other than taking damage. This effect\ncan be used once per game.\n\nSimply being an infernalist does not create a visible stigma on a character’s aura. A diabolist does not show taint or corruption until she utilizes an infernal power. When she does (and while that power is in effect), the character’s aura shows the clear corruption of infernal taint. Further, anyone who witnesses you use a major infernal effect will automatically notice your infernal taint whether or not they are using Auspex.\nA character can never permanently lose this merit. Demonic compacts are inviolable, and there is no way to escape a bargain once you have become part of the infernal chain of command. The only way out of such an agreement is death — and even then, the character’s soul is forever damned into the service of her diabolic master.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When you create art or undertake a performance, you can choose one appropriate emotion or state of thought to be reflected in that endeavour. Anyone viewing the art or observing the performance feels that emotion. If an individual wishes to take an action that runs contrary to the chosen emotion, such as attacking someone in the presence of a painting that invokes calm, she may spend 1 Willpower. If she does so, she ignores all Absent Sway effects for the next hour.\n\nThe effects of Absent Sway are passive, not aggressive, and encourage observers to feel emotion or enter a certain state of mind. The emotion encouraged by the art is felt by the victim, but Absent Sway does not force the victim to act in any specific manner. You might paint a picture that provokes viewers to feel the emotion “anger.” The manner in which the individual responds to feeling anger is up to the player of that character. However, if the character wishes to act in some manner that is diametrically opposed or contradictory to the emotion encouraged by the Absent Sway, she must spend 1 Willpower. For example, if she was in the presence of the painting that evoked “anger,” she would not have to punch the person beside her, but she would be forced to spend a point of Willpower if she wanted to start peace negotiations, or announce she has forgiven her enemies for\ntheir past slights.\n\nAbsent Sway cannot affect individuals in combat and has no effect once combat starts, but the power can make it difficult for characters to start combat in the first place. Absent Sway only functions when placed on art that is of significant size or easy to observe. Only characters who can plainly see the art or performance are affected by Absent Sway. A character does not have to spend a point of Willpower to overcome Absent Sway if acting upon the emotion caused by the art would cause the character harm or prevent the character from acting in self-preservation. \n\n",

Because prey was scarce in the subterranean lairs, to ensure the survival of the Hungry the Creeps were forced to embrace generation after generation in a depraved attempt to cultivate and control a vampire herd from which to feed. These generations never saw the surface world and survived trapped in massive underground cave systems they call the Depths. Many remained in a blood-starved torpor, forgotten and ignored until they were woken to hunt, feed, or to be fed on.

This light does nothing to reduce the Salubri’s reputation as an infernalist; on the contrary, faith could evince from any number of sources — including evil ones.

A target can only be affected by one application of Pierce the Veil in a given round. For example, if two Brahman Ravnos possess this merit, the first Brahman may use Pierce the Veil to make a Chimerstry Social attack against a target, allowing the second Brahman to target that same character with another Chimerstry Social attack, but the second Brahman’s attack counts against the maximum number of Social attacks the target can receive that round.\n\nYou may also use Pierce the Veil to target a character who normally could not be targeted due to having reached the maximum number of attacks possible in that round. For example, if another a character targets your intended target with a Social attack using the Presence discipline prior to your initiative in a given round, you could still use Pierce the Veil to attempt a Chimerstry Social attack on the same target.\n\n\n \n\n",

You cannot summon the Loa more than once per turn, and this ability cannot benefit any actions that take longer than one turn to complete.

For example, you may use this background to temporarily increase your Lore skill, but it will not grant you additional Lore skill specializations.

To do so, you must start with one of your Retainers. As it becomes a Vozhd, it gains 3 bonus levels of Stock NPC rating in addition to its current levels. These bonus ratings do not affect the XP cost to further increase the Retainer’s level. You may then give it one Animal Retainer trait. It also gains 2 Physical attribute focuses: an exception to the rule preventing Stock NPCs from having Physical attribute focuses. Lastly, it grows one size category for every 3 levels of NPC rating it possesses, up to a maximum of Delta. This merit can be combined with other merits or disciplines for ghouls, but you can only make one Vozhd every six game sessions or three months, whichever is shorter, due to the difficulty of gathering components and growing specimens.

While other Toreador focus on their paintings or their voices, your talents are a little more grotesque. When using your Crafts skill test pool, you may incorporate your Vicissitude powers to create objects that are shockingly and disturbingly alive. These objects are fully functional and are imbued with a horrifying biological capability. For example, a book may have a mouth and the ability to read itself to you, a harp may have arms to pluck itself, or a piece of furniture may have moving legs to arrange itself when commanded.\n\nTo use this merit, declare your intent to use it to the Storyteller and select a single function to imbue into a crafted item. Using this merit causes you to enter the next game session with a number of Beast traits appropriate to killing an animal or human donor, subject to any modifiers, such as those granted by Morality merits. In most cases, a human donor is required to craft an item using Visceral Artisan, but some simple functions can be accomplished with animal components. Donor specimens cannot be supernatural creatures other than ghouls; the physiology of supernatural creatures simply does not work with your\nmethods.\n\nOnce you have gathered sufficient materials, make a static challenge using your Crafts skill test pool against the difficulty of the object you’re creating. If you succeed, the object takes on the intended characteristic. If you fail, the Storyteller determines if you must either start again, or if the object is created, but with a darker functionality or consequence.\n\nObjects created in using Visceral Artisan require some trivial degree of maintenance, such as feeding it an occasional bit of raw meat; these objects do not require any downtime actions to maintain. If fed your Blood, they survive indefinitely, and they can be subjected to the blood bond. However, if these objects are abandoned, not cared for, or lack the functionality to feed themselves, they will die. These objects are undeniable breeches of the Masquerade and are typically hidden away, even when lovingly cherished by their owners.\n\n\n\n",

If you use this ability in conjunction with the Auspex discipline power Heightened Senses, you can extend Blood in the Water’s range to 1 mile on land and to 10 miles underwater. \n\nIf you have identified a source of blood, you may attempt a tracking challenge to find its source. Should you identify multiple sources with open wounds, you gain a vague sense of distance and direction for each, and you may choose which one to pursue. Blood in the Water does not convey an ability to know the identity of a target; you are only aware of the presence of open wounds. \n\nMechanically, a character is considered to have open wounds if she has 1 or more points of damage in her wound track that was gained within the past hour. Should you attempt a damage-dealing attack against a target with an open wound, you gain the Brutal and Deadly melee weapon equipment qualities. These qualities apply to any attack that deals damage, including Physical attacks or damaging powers, such as Psychic Assault. Note that Blood in the Water does not grant an exception to the rule preventing you from benefiting from the same equipment quality twice.\n\n",

When your knowledge has served its purpose, you can discard it, pursuing studies more relevant to your needs.\n\nProvided you have sufficient means to conduct research, you may spend one downtime action to switch one of your Academics, Linguistics, or Lore skill specializations for another one of your choice. In the case of Academics, simple internet access will suffice for the purposes of determining access to research. However, more obscure Languages or Lore requires access to a Haven with the Library specialization, at your Storyteller’s discretion.

You don’t need to know the power’s name, but you must be somewhat aware of its effects in order to target that power with Fervent Iconoclast.

This immunity includes any damage converted to aggravated damage, such as through the power Baal’s Caress; such damage is instead inflicted as normal damage. In addition, you take no bonus damage from effects such as those conveyed by the power Baal’s Bloody Talons, and the traits granted by that power do not apply when used against you.\n\nWith difficulty, you may also expel other supernatural poisons from yourself. If you are affected by a supernatural poison such as that conveyed by the powers The Slow Knife or Blur of the Weeping Eye, you can spend one simple action and 1 point of Blood per supernatural poison to expel them, vomiting them in an inert pool of blood. \n\n",

If you spend a standard action to examine it, you determine if your target possesses any skills at 4 dots or greater, and if so, which skills those are. This ability does not give you the exact score for each skill; it only tells you which skills are 4 dots or greater.\n\nTo brew the potion, spend 1 downtime action and choose a skill identified in the previous step to distill from the blood and create into a potion. This process wholly consumes the point of Blood. Create an item record to represent the potion, noting the skill chosen. Drinking the potion takes a simple action. After consuming it, for the next 10 minutes, or for the next two turns if combat takes place, you receive a +2 wild card bonus to the skill chosen when the potion was created.\n\nYou may only benefit from the use of one of these potions at a time, and you cannot benefit from a potion made of your own Blood.

They attempt to balance the intellect and emotions of Humanity against the instinct and savagery of the Beast: the balance of predator and prey. Such a balance is extremely difficult to reach, and upsetting the natural balance – of a vampire or of her environment – is against this moral code.\n\nSystem:\nYou do not gain Beast traits when performing a sin, as long as you commit that sin while actively attempting to balance your nature. If you act on any kind of emotional or instinctual extreme, you gain Beast traits as though you committed a level 1 sin. If you voluntarily resist frenzy, kill for any reason other than survival, or ignore your vampiric needs for blood and safety, you gain Beast traits as though you committed a level 4 sin. Followers of this path are called “Harmonists.”",

Although they are treated like ghouls, Dhampirs are not automatically blood bound and do not have a domitor. \n\nBuild your character using the rules for a standard ghoul, except where this merit specifically differs. Dhampirs are supernatural creatures, not mortals. They have no in-clan disciplines and place 7 (rather than the 5 dots normally assigned to ghouls) starting dots in any disciplines they choose. However, a dhampir can never purchase any discipline above the 3rd dot. Dhampir characters have no Beast and can never purchase a path merit. Unlike a ghoul, a dhampir cannot be Embraced; attempts to do so will simply kill the dhampir character.\n\n\n\n",

You emanate a feeling of serenity, a tangible reflection of the weakening of the Beast. Your Storyteller will work with you to determine which specific myths your character has heard and how much knowledge your character possesses about Golconda.\n\nTo make an attempt to reach Golconda, you need to have at least 4 points of the Lore skill, including Golconda lore. Additionally your Morality must be Humanity, at rating 5 or higher. Although purchasing the merit Golconda Seeker provides your character with clues about achieving Suspire, keep in mind that successfully achieving Golconda is exceptionally rare.

Both weapons must logically be able to hit your opponent in order to apply this advantage; thus, you cannot use this merit to apply an offhand sword’s quality when using a pistol’s ranged attack. Ambidextrous can be used during Celerity rounds. For more information on one-handed and two-handed weapons, ",

Sealed away by dark and shadowy monsters, those of this bloodline were conscripted in a plot against their parent clan. They spent the centuries being used as feeding stock, shock troops, and eventually spies – all to serve in a war they scarcely understood.

If the stories are true, she is believed to have escaped his clutches to birth the Nosferatu Clan. For her defiance, the other offspring of the founder hunted her, but yet no tangible evidence of these hunters were ever discovered. Over time, these pursuers became little more than ghost stories and boogeymen; myths told to scare ancillae and neonates.

Because prey was scarce in the subterranean lairs, to ensure the survival of the Hungry the Creeps were forced to embrace generation after generation in a depraved attempt to cultivate and control a vampire herd from which to feed. These generations never saw the surface world and survived trapped in massive underground cave systems they call the Depths. Many remained in a blood-starved torpor, forgotten and ignored until they were woken to hunt, feed, or to be fed on.

These nights, the newly embraced members of the bloodline often act as agents for older Nagaraja who in turn lead the bloodline to organize and strengthen its position. With few elders left in the clan, many Nagaraja are ignorant as to the truth of their bloodline’s beginnings. They are acutely aware that most, if not all, other vampires consider the Nagaraja a dangerous and vile bloodline of nefarious origin and are aware that their elders are seeking to change that narrative. The elders believe their best way to forge a path forward is to strike an accord with the other necromantic clans and bloodlines. However, they are adamant in their stance against the Followers of Set; a position which makes the Nagaraja a potentially polarizing ally.\n\n\n\n",
