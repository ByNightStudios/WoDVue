This includes Presence powers such as Entrancement, Merits such as Absent Sway, Dementation, Path of Corruption, and Dominate powers. The use of this power does not reveal who used the power on your target or other information. For example, in the case of Dominate, this power will not reveal what command was given. Instead, this power simply reveals that your target is currently under the effects of a mind or emotion-altering power. Passive effects that do not directly come from powers, such as the Blood Bond or infernal ties, cannot be identified through this technique, as they are too subtle to notice. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of what is considered an emotion altering power. \n\n",

This negotiation cannot take place during combat. If the target does not have fae lore, another party may attempt to negotiate on her behalf. The Storyteller determines what the piskies might want; for example, sums of money may suffice, or they may want her car keys for a joyride, depending on the piskies’ current mood. \n\nAt the end of the power’s duration, the piskies get bored and move along, causing the penalties to end immediately. Your target can only be affected by a single instance of this power at a given time. Additional applications extend the power’s duration, but they cannot raise the maximum cumulative penalty.\n\n\n\n",

You cannot use this power to alter the apparent number of inhabitants of the vehicle you are driving, but you can obscure or tint the vehicle’s windows.\n\nStealth Vehicle allows you to deeply attune to the vehicle you are driving, enabling you to adapt to minute changes in performance or traffic. You gain the appropriate Drive skill specialization for the vehicle you’re operating. If you already have that specialization, you gain an additional +5 wild card bonus to Drive and Streetwise skill test pools while this power is active, and you can benefit from the Streetwise skill while driving a vehicle, even through suburban or rural areas. The power lasts for one hour or until you cease driving the vehicle, whichever is shorter.\n\n\n\n",

                            "value": "When you activate Form of the Cobra, you may choose to turn into a nest of snakes instead of one creature. The nest consists of one snake for each Obfuscate power that you possess. Elder powers and Obfuscate-based techniques do not increase the number of serpents created by Snake Den. Each serpent can act independently and can take one simple and one standard action each turn. While using Snake Den, you cannot spend Blood and lose access to all other powers, except where noted below. Even powers that were activated before using Snake Den stop functioning while in this form. Activating Snake Den does not reverse permanent physical alterations. For example, if your heart is removed, it does not reappear when you activate this power.\n\nThe snakes resemble natural snakes typical of the average in size for their species. Each of your snakes has your Mental attribute, Social attribute, focuses and skills. Each of your serpents has a Physical attribute equal to half of your own Physical attribute (round up). While under the effects of Snake Den, your snakes retain the immunity to grapple and the ability to make venomous bite attacks provided by Form of the Serpent. By default, these serpents inflict 1 point of aggravated damage with a successful Brawl attack. If your character possesses any Potence powers, your snakes’ attacks are armor-piercing and inflict 2 points\nof aggravated damage.\n\nEach snake has 5 health levels (1 Healthy, 2 Injured, and 2 Incapacitated). Your merits, flaws, and powers do not affect the health levels of your serpents. If your character possesses any Fortitude powers, each of your snakes automatically negates 1 point of normal or aggravated damage each time they suffer damage. If your serpents attempt to retest in combat, each creature must spend Willpower separately; they use your Willpower pool to do so.\n\nIn addition, your snakes can squirm into narrow spaces and writhe out of reach; as a result, unless you are physically confined in a specially secured location, such as a watertight tank, you may declare the nest’s intent to fair escape. Each snake in the nest must be involved in a suitable challenge in order to successfully prevent your fair escape, according to the normal rules of fair escape.\n\nSnakes created by Snake Den can separate and perform individual tasks, but they must remain within one mile of each other. You can use a standard action to return to your human form at the location of any serpent created by this power. When you revert to human form, you automatically reabsorb any of your snakes that are within your line of sight. Snakes not within your line of sight crumble at the same moment, turning into ash. When Snake Den ends, you take 2 points of aggravated damage for each animal that was destroyed, 1 point of aggravated damage for each animal that was injured or incapacitated, and you lose 2 points of Blood for each animal that was outside of your line of sight when you reformed. Damage taken from reverting to human form cannot be reduced or negated, but it cannot kill your character (although it may result in torpor). If all the snakes in a Snake Den nest are destroyed, the power’s user dies.\n\nSnakes created by this power are considered to be one entity for the purpose of powers that modify an individual’s behavior. If one serpent is targeted by a Dominate power, all the snakes in the nest suffer the effects of that power. If one snake cannot break an individual’s Majesty, none of the serpents in the nest can attack that individual. Note that each snake in the nest must still be targeted by separate challenges in order to prevent fair escape, however. Snake Den is a major transformation power and cannot be combined with other major transformation powers\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While wearing your skin, the wearer appears lithe and serpentine, as if she had activated the power herself. The skin conveys no additional benefit if the wearer activates Skin of the Adder on her own.\n\n•\t Humanoid Skin: If you shed your skin in while in your natural, humanoid form, anyone who wears your skin takes on your appearance, seeming to all onlookers to be a perfect physical copy of you, including your height, weight, and presented gender. \n\nAt the next sunset after you shed it, the skin desiccates and becomes unwearable. Except as explicitly stated in the benefits listed above, your skin does not confer your Social attribute focus to the wearer, nor does it change the wearer’s aura. If a mortal or ghoul wears your skin, she can wear your skin during daylight hours.\nWearing the skin created by this power is a major transformation power and cannot be combined with other major transformation powers. The skin itself is flexible, but it does not stretch to accommodate other major transformations. Should the wearer assume such a form, the skin either tears irreparably or hangs uselessly, at the Storyteller’s discretion. \n\n\n",

For example, a vampire with 1 Beast trait responds to rage, fire, and hunger as if she had 3 Beast traits.\n\nWhile this power may prompt a target to commit acts during frenzy that lower her Humanity score, the effects of Mortal Terror do not apply when determining Humanity loss. For example, if a vampire has 3 or 4 Beast traits, she does not automatically lose a point of Humanity for reaching 5 or more Beast traits due to Mortal Terror. She does, however, make degeneration challenges and tests to resist frenzy including the penalty from Mortal Terror in addition to her current number of Beast traits.\n\nIn addition, your target must attempt to resist frenzy if her new Beast trait total causes her to meet the conditions for a frenzy check. For example, if a target of Mortal Terror is considered to have 3 Beast traits and she is also in the presence of a large flame, she must test to resist fear frenzy. Likewise, if her total number of Blood points is less than half of her total Blood pool, or if she receives 2 or more points of damage in a single blow, she must test to resist frenzy as well.\n\nMortal Terror augments Dread Gaze. Other powers that affect the use of Dread Gaze, such as Pavis of the Foul Presence or Tyrant’s Gaze, affect this technique also, including any attribute focus effects or when re-exerting the power as part of an exceptional success. This power may be used in conjunction with Fearful Blow or other powers that augment Dread Gaze.

For the next hour, your weapon has the quality granted by Illusory Augmentation in addition to its normal qualities.

The weapon retains the illusory quality as long as it remains in your hands; should you be disarmed or attempt to hand it to another, the effects immediately cease. No weapon can benefit from more than a single application of this power. Should you activate this power while it is already active, the previous application ends. As a reminder, you cannot benefit from the same quality twice, regardless of the source.

Using this power can cause your character to enter torpor if you lose exactly all of your remaining health levels. If you activate this power and the damage it inflicts exceeds your remaining health levels, you enter torpor and your soul is immediately ripped from your body and brought before your demonic master. Whether you return from such an encounter is up to the Storyteller’s discretion, as are the conditions of your return.\n\nThis power only works against a single effect at a time.

When your quills are extended, anyone who succeeds in challenge against you using the Brawl skill, takes 2 points of normal damage as their flesh is torn by the quills. In addition, whenever you successfully grapple another character, your target takes 2 points of normal damage.\n\n•\t Deformed: You may inflict a punishing disfigurement on a target, which renders her hideous. When you apply this Bonecraft effect, you may remove the Appearance focus from your target. You may also reduce her Social attribute by up to 3 points, if you desire. The Deformed effect does not reduce your target’s mobility.\n\n•\t Elongated Gait: Sacrifice 1 health level to enhance your running physiology. This alteration can be accomplished through a variety of means, such as by permitting quadrupedal running, or extending your ankle and forefoot similar to a kangaroo. Whenever you expend an action on movement, increase the number of steps you can take by one. For example, a character who normally takes three steps per action used for movement could move a total of four steps per action while using this benefit.\n\n•\t Second Stomach: Sacrifice 1 to 3 health levels. For each health level removed, increase your maximum Blood pool by 2. As a marvel of Vicissitude, you retain this additional capacity even if you should assume a different form. This is an exception to the rule limiting Bonecraft alterations only to your natural form.\n\nThese modifications are adjudicated by the rules for Bonecraft (see MET:VTM, page 168). Selecting any of the above augmentations counts against the maximum number of modifications a character may apply with Bonecraft. Note that Bonecraft is not a transformative power.\n\n",

When you activate Blood Tempering, choose one of the following applications:\n\n•\t Damaged or Old Equipment: This application of Blood Tempering allows you to operate nearly any equipment, as long as it is mostly intact. For example, if your truck has an engine and gasoline, it runs for the next hour, even if half the spark plugs are missing and there is a two-inch hole in the radiator. If your computer has a processor, keyboard, and a monitor, you can make it work like a highend machine for one hour.  When using this application, assign the target item two equipment qualities of your choice —excluding Flashy or Masterwork. The chosen qualities must logically suit the equipment, as though it were new or undamaged. For the duration of this power, you cannot use the object’s original qualities, if it had any.\n\n•\t Improvised Weapon: Almost anything is a weapon in your hands. This application\nof Blood Tempering allows you to give an improvised weapon the qualities of a real weapon for the next hour. For example, you might make a nail gun that is as effective as a rifle, a broom handle that works like a mace, or a piece of scrap metal that functions like a sword. When using this power, assign the target improvised weapon two weapon qualities of your choice — excluding Flashy or Masterwork. The chosen qualities must be vaguely logical for your improvised weapon to possess, and you cannot assign supernatural qualities or qualities that do not match the form and function of the weapon. For example, you cannot make a baseball bat function like a pistol, and you cannot make a piece of steel behave like a silver weapon. For the duration of this power, you cannot use the improvised weapon’s original qualities, if it had any.\n\n•\t Incorrect Equipment: This application of Blood Tempering allows you to force a target piece of equipment to work for one specific situation for the next hour. For example, you might scrape at a random key until it fits the lock you are trying to open, or you might jury-rig a ½-inch wrench to work on a ¾-inch bolt. As long as the tool is similar to the specific item you need, you can make it work.\n\n•\t Unbreakable: This specialized application grants a weapon or object extraordinary durability, albeit temporarily. For the duration of this power, you can grant the Unbreakable quality to a piece of equipment. This item loses this quality if another individual handles or attempts to wield it. For as long as it possesses this quality, both mundane and supernatural effects are unable to break this item or compromise its physical integrity.\n\n\n\n",

Confirming that his Retainer is within three steps of his location, Zeke’s player declares his intent to use Bestial Allure and have his mountain lion use the Assist Attacker Stock NPC mass combat tactic to assist him with the challenge. The mountain lion does so, providing Zeke with a +5 wild card bonus to his Dread Gaze challenge. Later in the turn, Zeke is targeted by Eyes of the Serpent, which also utilizes his Social attribute.

If a shapeshifter who is inherently vulnerable to gold targets you with a supernatural power that costs gnosis, that character must spend 1 additional point of gnosis to target you, or that power fails. In addition, you don’t have to spend Blood points when activating your own Presence powers.\n\n•\t Iron: Iron represents the planet Mars and embodies aggressive energy. You receive a +2 wild card bonus when defending against Animalism powers. Once per turn, when you receive a Physical attack that scored an exceptional success, you may reduce that attack to a normal success. When you inflict damage against changelings vulnerable to cold iron, your damage is aggravated.\n\n•\t Lead: This metal shares its symbol with the planet Saturn. You become immune to the\nKnock Down combat maneuver and the Knockback equipment quality, and you may spend a simple action to increase your weightup to four times your normal weight. In addition, you receive a +2 wild card bonus when defending against Temporis powers.\n\n•\t Quicksilver: Also known as mercury, this metal shares its symbol with the planet of the same name. You gain the Fast equipment quality, and if you spend both your simple and standard actions on movement, you may take three additional steps. For example, a character who normally takes three steps per action used for movement could move a total of nine steps while using this benefit.\n\n•\t Silver: Silver represents the Moon and clarity. Your attacks that use your Brawl skill to form your test pool gain the Silver equipment quality. When you inflict damage against shapeshifters vulnerable to silver, your damage is aggravated. If a shapeshifter who is inherently vulnerable to silver targets you with a supernatural power that costs gnosis, that character must spend 1 additional point of gnosis to target you, or that power fails. In addition, you don’t have to spend Blood points when activating your own Auspex powers.\n\n•\t Tin: The metal of the planet Jupiter, this metal carries the energy of sovereignty. You take 1 fewer point of damage from electrical or lightning sources. Apply the damage-reduction benefit of this power prior to calculating damage reduction from other powers, such as Fortitude. In addition, you do not have to spend points of Blood to activate\nyour own Dominate powers. Use of this power is a major transformation, and it cannot be used in conjunction with other major transformation powers.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

One Beast trait will fade after the next game session;\nthe second will fade after two game sessions. Feast of Shadow can never raise your maximum Blood pool by more than 5. Only the character invoking Feast of Shadow can feed from the Abyss; you cannot share this Blood with anyone unless they feed directly from you, in which case, they are drinking your blood, not the Abyss, and gain no Abyssal taint or bonuses.\n\n\n",

                            "value": "When you activate Shape of the Beast, you may choose to turn into a swarm of animals instead of one creature. You transform into slightly smaller versions of the same animal you would normally become by using Shape of the Beast. If your Shape of the Beast allows you to turn into a bat, you can turn into several smaller bats using Animal Swarm.\n\nThis swarm consists of one animal for each dot of Celerity you possess. Elder powers and Celerity-based techniques do not increase the number of animals created by Animal Swarm. Each animal can act independently and can take one simple and one standard action each turn. While using Animal Swarm, you cannot spend Blood and lose access to all other powers. Even powers that were activated before using Animal Swarm stop functioning while in this form.\n\nActivating Animal Swarm does not reverse permanent physical alterations. For example, if your heart is removed it will not reappear when you activate this power. Each of your animals has your Mental attribute, Social attribute, focuses and skills. By default, these animals inflict 1 point of aggravated damage with a successful Brawl attack. If your character possesses any Potence powers, your animals’ attacks are armor-piercing and inflict 2 points of aggravated damage. Each creature has 5 health levels (1 Healthy, 2 Injured, and 2 Incapacitated). Your merits, flaws, and powers do not affect the health levels of your animal swarm. \nIf your character possesses any Fortitude powers, each of your animals automatically negates 1 point of normal or aggravated damage each time they suffer damage. If your animals attempt to retest in combat, each animal must spend Willpower separately; they use your Willpower pool to do so. While swarming in your flight form, each animal gains a +1 bonus to Dodge-based defensive test pools and can fly at your normal movement speed. \n\nIn flight form, your Physical attribute is considered 1 when you are attacking. While in fight form, each of your animals has a Physical attribute equal to half of your own Physical attribute (round up). Other bonuses from Shape of the Beast do not apply while using Animal Swarm.\n\nAnimals created by Animal Swarm can separate and perform individual tasks, but must remain within one mile of each other. You can use a standard action to return to your human form at the location of any animal created by this power. When you revert to human form, you automatically reabsorb any of your animals that are within your line of sight. Animals not within your line of sight crumble at the same moment, turning into ash. When Animal Swarm\nends, you take 2 points of aggravated damage for each animal that was destroyed, 1 point of aggravated damage for each animal that was injured or incapacitated, and you lose 2 Blood for each animal that was outside of your line of sight when you reformed. Damage taken from reverting to human form cannot be reduced or negated, but cannot kill your character (although it may result in torpor). If all of the animals in a swarm are destroyed, the power’s user dies. Animals created by this power are considered to be one entity for the purpose of powers that modify an individual’s behavior. If one animal is Dominated, all of the animals in\nthe swarm suffer the effects of that power. If one animal cannot break an individual’s Majesty, none of the animals in the swarm can attack that individual.\n\n\n",

While your opponent is grappled in this way, you can move and act normally without ending the effects of the grapple; this is an exception to the rules limiting your ability to move farther than one step or target other characters while maintaining a grapple. If an individual grappled by this power attempts to escape, she must succeed in a static challenge using her Physical attribute + Brawl or Melee skill, (if appropriately armed) versus your Social attribute + Survival skill.

The dark mist created in this manner has the power to confuse and befuddle mortals.\n\n",

Choose one of the following types:\n\n•\t Dreadful Gloom: You create a supernatural gloom that afflicts the minds of any mortals who linger within it, filling a single room or area up to 100 square feet in size. Once activated, this function takes one minute to fully manifest, and visibility within it is reduced to 10 steps in any direction. Immediately after the gloom has fully manifested, any non-supernatural human who breathes within it is placed in a semi-hypnotic state. They will continue the activities they were taking immediately prior to the gloom’s manifestation, acting as if the gloom or anything they see or experience is perfectly normal, so long as they continue to breathe it in. As soon as any non-supernatural humans cease to breathe in the gloom, they forget anything they experienced while under its effects.\n\n•\t Tenebrous Haze: You summon a murky haze that befuddles the minds of mortals trying to escape its reach. Each application of this power fills a single floor of a building. Once activated, this function takes five minutes to fully manifest, and visibility is reduced to 20 steps in any direction. Any non-supernatural humans who breathe within it enter a state of mild agitation that turns into panic if they are startled. When that happens, they become frightened and confused by their surroundings, seeking to flee, but unable to find any exits. Any frightened, non-supernatural human who seeks to leave an area affected by Tenebrous Haze must succeed in a static challenge using their Mental attribute + Investigation skill versus your Mental Attribute + the number of dots you possess of Obtenebration powers, including any techniques or elder powers, before she can locate an exit. Humans who succeed are able to lead other humans to escape, should those mortals agree to follow.\n\n•\t Fog Bank: You conjure a dark fog that enshrouds an area roughly equal to a square mile. This power can only be used outdoors. Once activated, this function takes 10 minutes to fully manifest, and visibility within the fog is limited to 100 steps in any direction. Within the fog, damage caused to vampires by sunlight is reduced by half (round up). This is an exception to the rule that prevents a vampire’s powers from reducing the damage she receives from sunlight. A vampire who is wholly covered in clothing can attempt a brief\nexposure, suffering 1 point of aggravated damage for each total minute spent in sunlight within a Fog Bank. In addition, the fog is mildly distorting to the senses. Anyone attempting to track another character through the fog receives a -5 penalty to their tracking challenge.\n\nRegardless of the type chosen, Black Mist dissipates in one hour, or sooner if there is a significant wind in the area. Black Mist dissipates in 10 minutes under full sunlight. You may layer the various types of Black Mist within each other, and you may also summon a regular Shroud of Night within them as well. The effects of  such layered powers are cumulative (apply the most restrictive visibility). You may choose to conjure Black Mist in an area smaller than its maximum limit. Unlike Shroud of Night, you cannot move your Black Mist, nor can you increase its size. You can have only a single instance of each of the three types of Black Mist active at a given time.\n\n\n\n",
