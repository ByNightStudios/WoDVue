In addition, if a power requires her to designate allies, she may not do.

The characteristics of the blood requirement cannot include disease, blood alcohol content, or drugs. This ritual will override the Ventrue clan weakness and the Prey Exclusion flaw.

For each supporter that continues to chant, the champion receives a +2 wild card bonus to all challenges that utilize the champions Occult skill in the formation of the challenge test pools.For this ritual to remain in effect, the supporters of the ritual must concentrate and spend their standard action to maintain the ritual by audibly chanting the champion’s name. All participants may rise and walk but must remain one step away from each other and continue to chant in order to continue to grant their power. Clever foes fighting against this ritual will often try to knock out at least one supporter to weaken the champion.

For the next lunar month, you may spend a simple action to open this container while speaking a mystical Koldunic phrase and target any one fire no larger than a family home. At the end of the turn, the targeted fire is immediately extinguished by a massive gust of wind. This gust ends the lingering effects of powers such as Wall of Fire, Engulf, and Firestorm. The winds linger for 5 minutes, extinguishing any new fires at the end of each turn. Once opened, the container is rendered inert as the ritual is expended.

This applies to mundane and mystical sources.  For example, if a character under the effects of this ritual stood in a bonfire or s targeted by Engulf or Firestorm, she would be immune to both the initial and ongoing damage; however, if she was targeted by a second instance of Engulf, she would not be immune.

Animals, even supernatural ones or vampires using Subsume the Spirit, will not activate it; however, werewolves or similar shapeshifters will trigger the ward, even in their animal form. Once cast, a ward may not be moved or it will activate and lose its power, even if the object itself is portable. If your ward is somehow moved and then activated, you will not be aware of its new location. You may have a number of these wards in existence equal to your Occult skill.

The Storyteller will determine the precise effect, but it will never be in a way that the Setite directly and immediately benefits from. For example, it might alter the lock of a door so it cannot be unlocked with its original key. However, it will not suddenly be able to be opened by a key the Setite holds. Whatever the effect, it will end after 1 day has passed. The paste does not have any effect when applied to a living, once living, or undead creature. A Setite can only have three applications of this paste active at a time. If she creates another batch, the oldest batch is rendered inert. Each batch has one use.",
