They are a pestilence, and they exist only by harming others. Further, vampirism reduces an individual’s capacity to feel positive emotions, slowly wearing away the individual’s compassion, empathy, and ability to recognize good from evil. These things are all cast aside by the curse that brings a vampire back from death. With human drives and desires twisted by a raging Beast that demands survival at any cost, vampires must cling to their beliefs.

This practice requires one vampire to drink from another, exsanguinating all of the victim’s blood and continuing past that point to feast upon a vampire’s very soul. To do so imbues the diablerist with new potency, permanently concentrating her blood. This act terrifies elders, who fear that a time may come when young, thin-blooded vampires will rise up and attempt to steal the elders’ power, consuming their souls in the process.\nVampires known to have practiced such an act are typically hunted down and destroyed.\n\nThere are many spiritual beliefs concerning diablerie. Some clans believe it is a spiritual act, one that forever merges the soul of the diablerist with her victim. Others claim that it is a vampire’s way of delivering God’s greatest punishment, removing a particularly evil soul from the cycle forever. Many vampire faiths have doctrines explaining the nature of diablerie within their belief systems, and even outside of these religious beliefs, vampires are highly superstitious and fearful of the act.\nUndead legend tells many dark tales of murderous childer betraying and cannibalizing their sires, and it is for this reason more than any other that elder vampires harbor a great distrust for weaker vampires. Further, diablerie is addictive, and those who commit this sin even once fi nd that their Beasts rage forever with a powerful, almost unconquerable desire to do so again. Even centuries later, they can still remember the taste of the heart’s blood, and they occasionally awaken from dreams wherein they were experiencing the blissful moment\nof gluttony over and over again.\n\nThose who commit diablerie experience the spiritual merging of the consumed soul into their bodies. Memories, along with the power of that individual’s blood, surge through the practitioner at the time of the act, and those memories will linger for the rest of the vampire’s eternal existence. In ancient days, clans such as the Salubri and the Assamites claimed to know secrets that allowed diablerists to access their victims’ memories freely and live in peace with those they had consumed. Few modern vampires have this capacity or knowledge. A diablerist finds herself forever changed, her personality affected by the resonance of the person she diablerized. Unlike the Beast, the victim’s spirit is not sentient within the diablerist, but rather exists as a subtle influence, like old habits or unquestioned beliefs. A diablerist will find herself remembering half-understood moments of her victim’s life as if they were her own, and she will discover that her perspective on the world has forever been colored by the\npersonality of the individual whose spirit she has consumed\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"system":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"bold"}],"value":"Committing Diablerie","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\nTo commit diablerie, you must torpor a vampire and drain all of her blood.

There is no limit to the number of characters whom you can reward for roleplaying, but no single character can regain Willpower from you more than once per night. To regain Willpower more than once per night in this fashion, a player must roleplay with multiple characters.\n• Storyteller Acknowledgement: When the Storyteller notices a player roleplaying her character well, she may elect to refresh some or all of the character’s spent Willpower. By default, the Storyteller refreshes all of the character’s spent Willpower (just like a player would), but the Storyteller is allowed to award fewer Willpower if the situation warrants it. Storytellers may refresh Willpower as often as they like and may refresh the same character’s Willpower more than once per night. Storytellers should not hesitate to use this ability when they witness a player roleplaying in a way that other players do not see or do not acknowledge.

If you try to act at the same time as another character, the character acting on her natural initiative goes first. If two players use Burst of Speed at the same time, the character with the highest initiative goes first.\n\n• Blinding Attack : If you succeed with a Blinding Attack, your opponent suffers 3 less damage (minimum 0), but is blinded until she spends two simple actions clearing her eyes.\n\n• Disarm : Modify your attack test pool by -2. If you succeed in the challenge, you force your target to drop one item of your choice. Picking the item up requires a standard action. If you are Dexterity-focused and have a free hand, you may choose to end up holding the disarmed object. Normally this maneuver can only be used on an object the target is holding in her hands, but the Storyteller may allow you to use this maneuver to take unsecured items off the target, such as a cord tied around her neck, a hat, or a rod sticking out of her pocket. Disarm cannot be used to remove l arge or secured items, such as a jacket or chain mail.\n\n• Grapple : If you succeed with a Grapple attack, your opponent takes 3 less damage (minimum 0) and is grappled. While grappled she can’t move and cannot use her standard action to take a Physical action. She can escape from your Grapple by using a simple action and besting you in an opposed challenge (Brawl or Melee). Upon escaping, the target regains full use of her standard action. (She doesn’t have to wait until the next round to use it.) You relinquish your Grapple if you take any action that targets anyone other than the character you’re grappling, or if you move more than one step per round. If a single character is being grappled by more than one opponent, she need only best one opponent to escape. If the grappling characters cannot decide who will resist the attempt to break out, the Storyteller\ndecides. As long as your character is grappled, she is considered the target of a Physical challenge each round (allowing others to only target her with one additional Physical attack per round). With the right equipment or supernatural power, it is possible to Grapple at range, but a Grapple cannot be used as a prerequisite for a supernatural attack unless you Grapple with your hands. For example, you can’t throw a net at someone and then use Cauldron of Blood, because you have not grappled the target with your hands.\n\n• Knock Out : If you surprise your target, you may attempt to knock her unconscious. Modify your attack test pool by -2. If you succeed, your target is unconscious for 10 minutes. You can only use this maneuver during the first round of combat, and you can’t use it if your target\nis expecting an attack.

While prone, your opponent may use an action to crawl one step. A prone character can use a simple action to stand up and move up to one step.\n\n• Fighting Blind : If you can’t see your opponent, you must use this combat maneuver to attack her. If you don’t use this combat maneuver, your attack will automatically miss.\n\n• Pierce the Heart : If your opponent’s wounds are in the Incapacitated wound track, you may attempt to use a melee or ranged weapon to Pierce her Heart. Modify your attack test pool by -3 when attempting this maneuver. If you hit a mortal with this attack, she is instantly killed.

Not every location can be “owned” in the classical sense, with a formal deed in the character’s name. A variety of desirable locations are public property, impossible to be wholly owned by a private entity. However, supernatural creatures have various means to exert influence over mortals. Gaining de facto control of a location is just as effective as de jure. This power can be ascertained through indirect means, such as a vampire establishing a blood bond, a werewolf sending kinfolk to fill key operational positions, or a changeling weaving an elaborate web of seduction to ensnare a city council member. For the purpose of this system, determining the nature of the control exerted is  necessary only for story, as the system treats all means as effectively equal.\n\nIn addition, not every location is obtainable. A Storyteller is free to determine as befits her game whether a particular location can be controlled.

A character who controls this location receives one additional Elite influence action each downtime cycle.\n- Firewall: This location has been designed to prevent others from remotely accessing its data and security systems. The difficulty of attempts to penetrate computer systems at this location increases by 3. Characters with both the Computer skill and have purchased the Haven background for this location receive the Firewall benefit for free.\n- Guards: Armed guards regularly patrol this location. Anyone who tries to infiltrate this location must contend with 5 dots of Retainers guarding it. When choosing this quality, the player may assign five level-1 Retainers, one level-5 Retainer, or any other combination adding up to five. Guards also add +1 to the difficulty of any quest to physically infiltrate the location. Location guards only protect this location, and they cannot travel\n- Hangout: This location is a gathering place for mortal residents from various walks of life. Its controller gains access to one additional instance of the Contacts background at 1 dot. This benefit does not raise the level of a character's existing Contacts, and it is treated as a separate background.\n- Historic: This location has cultural or historical significance, making control of it much more complicated. Add +1 to the difficulty of any quest to take control of this location.\n- Lowdown and Dirty: This location is a spot where underworld figures love to congregate, making it easy for its controller to orchestrate deals. A character who controls this location receives one additional Underworld influence action each downtime cycle. Hole in the Wall: This location is difficult to find unless you know what you're looking for. This location cannot be targeted or affected by other characters unless they have personally been there.\n- Isolated: This location is isolated from mortals, and is thus relatively safe as regards the Masquerade. Only the most egregious breaches attract outside attention.\n- Laboratory: This location contains a highly specialized research laboratory. Choose one Science skill specialization. This location confers a +3 wild card bonus to challenges related to that field of study. A location can have multiple instances of the Laboratory quality, applying to a different Science specialization each time.\n- Library: The location features an extensive library, on a variety of subjects not accessible to mortals. Before making a Lore skill test, a character may spend one hour looking things up in the library and receive a +3 wild card bonus to her test pool.\n- Location: The location is in an area that affords it some protection, such as being in a prestigious neighborhood, atop a lonely mountain, or at the end of a winding, private road. Anyone using downtime actions to negatively affect this facility must spend twice as many downtime actions to do so. In addition, the Storyteller may award certain story benefits relevant to the location (police respond quickly when called, nearby roads get cleared first when the weather is bad, etc.)\n- Luxury: The location is filled with comfortable and expensive amenities, such as televisions, automatic chairs, computers, or works of art. The location owner receives a +3 bonus to Social attribute tests versus mortals in this location.\n- Off the Grid: This location has no electronic systems as part of its workings, yet it is fully functional in all other aspects, including security. This location cannot be infiltrated via the internet or be impacted through typical bureaucratic means\n- Profitable: This location generates income for its controller, treated as if she had an additional instance of the Resources background at 1 dot. This benefit does not raise the level of a character's existing Resources background, and it is treated as a separate background.\n- Public Property: This location is a public facility, owned by the local government, but controlled by a vampire. Add +3 to the difficulty of any bureaucratic action targeting this facility. In addition, this location ignores the first instance of the Out of Code negative quality assigned to it. The second instance of Out of Code is treated as the first, ultimately requiring four instances before the location is rendered inoperable.\n- Refuge: This location has an emergency power system, as well as food supplies (including blood, if controlled by a vampire). Each level of this location's rating gives it enough resources for a single individual to remain for 30 days without emerging, which the controller can divide to accommodate additional parties or combine for a longer duration for fewer characters.\n- Security: The location has a basic security system installed. Any challenges to break in suffer a -3 penalty. In addition, the controlling character always receives at least one turn of warning if she is present during a break-in attempt (no matter how well the attacker tests). Characters with the Security skill may receive this benefit for free on locations that are designated as their Haven background, but Security must be separately assigned to multiple locations.\n- Size: The location is enormous, with dozens of rooms, or a wide enclosed space. A warehouse's worth of goods, supplies, people, or anything else can be safely hidden away\nfrom the world here.\n- Sprawling: Characters unfamiliar with this location find it confusing to navigate. Characters wishing to speak privately should notify the Storyteller of their intent, and they are then considered to be in a different location for the purposes of observation. Furthermore, characters who do not control this stock location may not declare fair escape while present, and a character wishing to leave the site must spend five minutes unchallenged before making her exit.\n- Staff: The location includes several servants who see to the needs of the owner and guests. Staff don't normally fight; but if they are forced to engage, treat them as 1-dot Retainers with no combat specialties. They are available at all times, but are not entirely self-sufficient; Staff cannot be used to raise the total number of locations a character can control.\n- Sturdy: This location is particularly hard to ruin, thanks to solid construction. Add +3 to the difficulty of any action that would cause physical damage to this location, such as breaking down doors. In addition, the location ignores the first Damaged negative quality assigned to it. The second instance of Damaged is treated as the first, ultimately requiring four instances before the location is destroyed.\n- Venue: This location is an excellent performance venue. Choose one Performance skill specialization. This location confers a +3 wild card bonus to non-supernatural challenges related to that skill specialization. A location can have multiple instances of the Venue quality, applying to a different Performance specialization each time.\n- Workshop: This location is designed for making things. Choose one Craft skill specialization. This location confers a +3 wild card bonus to challenges related to that skill specialization. A location can have multiple instances of the Workshop quality, applying to a different Crafts specialization each time.\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"\n\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"sourceBook":[{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"yicuw1hpxsdg"}},"id":"18ZqrGQa6cKbUWo2sVcte0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-02-18T04:10:10.444Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-18T04:10:10.444Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sourcebook"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"bookTitle":"MET - VTM - V2 - Issue 1","system":["Vampire the Masquerade"]}}]},"sys":{"id":"2Wxnt05vVtLCMKcOcc99JV","type":"Entry"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"fields":{"title":"Hunters: Project Twilight","description":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Project Twilight encompassess government hunters that work for organizations with national or international reach.  These NPCs are not the same as local authorities such as the town sheriff, county officers, or even run of the mill FBI Agents.

For centuries, philosophers have debated the existence and purpose of the human soul, and considered how this nebulous concept defines our morals, actions, and how we relate to one another.\nSome claim that humanity’s entire existence has been an intrinsic, existential search to define the soul and explore its functionality, while seeking the true purpose behind life.\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Vampire: The Masquerade is a game that focuses on the internal struggle between darkness and light, right and wrong, virtue and vice.

At times, these outcomes may be social sanctions or physical encounters, but there is also a possibility that they will stir a vampire’s Beast. This dramatic system uses two unique traits to simulate and showcase this struggle:\n- Humanity is defined in Mind’s Eye Theatre: Vampire The Masquerade as a metric determining how much of a character’s mortal soul remains, despite the Curse of Caine. Humanity represents a vampire’s tie to morality: an endless struggle to some and a\nshield to others.\n- Beast traits represent the relative potency of a character’s Beast, increasing as it actively strengthens or emerges. Incurring a Beast trait represents a moment of weakness, surrendering to the seductive and destructive nature of the Beast. \nThe chart listed on page 300 of MET:VTM was designed to be a broad, quick-and-dirty guideline for Storytellers and players to easily determine how to assign Beast traits during the course of a game session. Using it, a vampire should be able to feel the slip of her Humanity on a nightly basis, taking a walk on the wild side without random significant loss. Losing Humanity is a long, slow grind—a story of true terror.\nThe following expanded system reorganizes and reimagines the previous rules, broadening them from the narrow perspective of engaging in violence to opening a character up to the depravations of the Beast.

However, there is a third option: riding the wave.\nA character who rides the wave seeks to satisfy her urges before they overcome her, rather than attempt  to deny them outright. Riding the wave is an extreme reaction to a frenzy-inducing stimulus, acknowledging it as a threat in a very overt way. Riding the wave is different from frenzy. Powers or effects that rely on a character being in frenzy do not apply when she is riding the wave. Instead, she is in a state just beneath frenzy.\nWhen confronted with a stimulus that would cause a frenzy check, players may choose instead to ride the wave. If they do, they skip the frenzy check, but must instead react in an extreme and dramatic fashion to the situation, possibly acting in a manner that others might consider embarrassing or overblown. However, to the character, the emotion she experiences is very real. When a character rides the wave, she must continue acting in a dramatic fashion until the stimulus of her frenzy is removed or resolved.\nThis outcome may require separating her from an offending party, ingesting some quantity of blood, extinguishing a fire, or leaving a location.

The vampire continues to do so until she has successfully consumed enough Blood points eliminate the need for a frenzy check.\n- Fear Frenzy: Fear frenzy is the Beast’s attempt to preserve itself in the face of a mortal threat. Rather than flee in uncontrollable terror, a character riding the wave may shriek, yell, or recoil away from the offending source.

Alternatively, vampires employing the gift Heightened Senses can track while in any form. The systems below should also be used when a character gains the opportunity to track by scent as a result of a merit or supernatural power.

This ritual is also performed to celebrate the sect’s acceptance of new True Sabbat when they are given Initiation through the Creation Rites.\n• Danse Macabre (also called the Farewell Ritus): This Ignoblis is more somber than others, and packs use it to bid farewell to the spirits and memories of fellow Sabbat after they have been destroyed. The farewell rites usually involve each person in attendance offering a sacrifice to go with the departed. When this ritual is performed on a nomadic pack leaving an area, these sacrifices are often gifts given to help that pack survive its travels.\n• Running the Gauntlet: This ritus includes physical games and challenges involving direct combat between two or more participants, always performed in some public manner, so that the rest of the Sabbat can watch and learn from the battle.\n• Sacrificial Rites: This ritual involves the sacrifice of a human, werewolf, or vampire. Typically, the first half of this ritus is a challenge to acquire an appropriate sacrifice (alive and not significantly harmed). Such a sacrifice is usually defined at the start of the ritus, and then the\nvampires are sent to perform the task. If they succeed, the sacrifice is performed in the bloodiest method possible, and its remains are left behind so that the enemies of the Sabbat can see, and fear, the power of the Sword of Caine.\n• Stealth: The Ignoblis Ritae of stealth come in many varieties, from vowing silence and cutting out tongues, to see who can remain silent the longest, to physical tests of silence, such as moving through a Camarilla-controlled area without gaining the attention of the enemy.\n• Sun Dance: The Sun Dance ritus is held from sunset to sunrise without pause. Pack members usually dress in masks or paint, depicting their greatest battles or most significant points of pride. The Sun Dance is a test of endurance; no wounds may be healed from the moment the ritus begins to the moment the sun rises on the next morning. The ritus involves chanting, dancing, counting coup upon other sect members (through a single strike) and praising one’s pack accomplishments.\n• Vision Quest: In some packs, if an individual wishes to become leader or seeks guidance from Caine, she goes on a vision quest. The Sabbat member’s vision quest involves meditation, starvation (no feeding for at least a week before the ritus), and a pageant play by her pack and associates. The topic of the pageant is always a relevant story of Caine or of vampiric myth and history, related to the individual’s questions and concerns.
