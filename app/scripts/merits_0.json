You might paint a picture that provokes viewers to feel the emotion “anger.” The manner in which the individual responds to feeling anger is up to the player of that character.

Nearly all supernatural creatures fear and hate infernalists and will kill characters with Infernal Power without question or remorse. Additionally, if you fail to obey your demonic master’s orders or displease the demon, you immediately lose access to this merit. Further, you take 5 points of aggravated damage, which cannot be reduced or negated by any means, for your failure to obey.\n\nThis does not free you from the infernal compact; it is only an expression of your master’s wrath. To regain the use of this merit, you must fulfill a task assigned by your infernal master: one that is always cruel, inhumane, and vile. If you fail to complete that task within 30 days, you meet Final Death. There is no escaping this fate.\n\nCharacters with Infernal Power must choose one of the following infernal gifts. Each infernal gift has two effects, one minor and one major. When you choose a gift, you gain access to both effects provided by that gift.\n\n• Gift: Demonic Fire\n› Minor Effect: Your Infernal Power grants you resistance to fire. Flaming weapons or incendiary weapons inflict normal damage instead of aggravated damage. Additionally, by expending a simple action (and no need for kindling or other fuel), you can create a small ball of greenish-black flame in the palm of your hand. This flame is approximately the size of a baseball. While holding demonic fire, your hand-to-hand attacks cause aggravated damage.\n› Major Effect: By expending a simple action, you can sheath your body in an aura of greenish-black flame for the next five minutes. You can end this effect at any time prior to the end of its duration by expending another simple action. While you are within this aura, your clothing and equipment are not damaged by fire and your Brawl and Melee attacks inflict aggravated damage. Anyone foolish enough to Grapple you, or who is grappling you when you activate this effect, takes 3 points of aggravated damage.\n\n• Gift: Profane Contract\n› Minor Effect: You are authorized by your demonic master to forge lesser contracts, offering another character infernal power in exchange for a portion of her immortal soul. The target of this effect cannot be forced into the bargain through supernatural powers or threats of violence, although she may be coerced through politics, general persuasion, treachery, or other social maneuvers. When she signs the contract, you become her infernal master, and she becomes your infernal servitor. The target gains access to her choice of one minor infernal effect, without needing to purchase the Infernal Power merit. The demon that bestows the infernal pact upon you gains power over any soul who willingly accepts an infernal contract from you. Your demonic master can rescind power from either of you, if it desires. \nIf your servitor disobeys or displeases you, you have the option to punish her by inflicting 5 points of aggravated damage, which cannot be reduced or negated by any means. You may also choose to strip the target’s infernal power and to require that she perform a dark task in order to regain the power. You must assign a task that is possible to achieve, but it can be as difficult or easy as you desire. If the target doesn’t complete your task within 30 days, she\nmeets Final Death. As with any infernal bargain, a lesser contract can only be negated if the target dies, or if you die. If you temporarily lose access to your Infernal Power merit, you cannot use any of these effects against your servitor, nor can you create new contracts. However, your underlings do not lose their powers simply because yours are in abeyance.\n› Major Effect: As long as you maintain at least one Profane Contract with another player-character, you may call upon your Infernal Power, step through the fires of hell, and appear at a place on the physical realm that is sacred to your demonic master, such as a diabolic temple or your infernal altar. To do so, you must concentrate for three full turns while chanting in an infernal language. When you appear at your chosen site, you may choose to spend one minute there and then return to the location you just left. Or, you may choose to remain at the place where you have traveled. You can use this effect once per game for each lesser contract you currently hold.\n\n• Gift: Unholy Regeneration\n› Minor Effect: If you have any damage in your Incapacitated wound track, you automatically regenerate 1 point of normal damage per turn without spending Blood. If you have no remaining normal damage, but still have aggravated damage in your Incapacitated wound track, you heal 1 point of aggravated damage every three turns. This merit heals a character on the her initiative during the everyman round; this power has no effect during Celerity rounds. This merit ceases to function if the character has no wounds in the Incapacitated wound track. Healing provided by this merit doesn’t require an action or an expenditure of Blood.\n› Major Effect: If you are damaged to the point of torpor or Final Death, you immediately resurrect in a blast of greenish-black flame. You resurrect at full health. For the next five turns, you receive a +5 wild card bonus to all defensive test pools. Before the end of that time, you must kill another character and verbally condemn your victim’s soul into your master’s power. If you fail to achieve this goal in the allotted time, you meet your Final Death permanently and irrevocably, regardless of health or any other supernatural power. You cannot use this effect if your infernal master is the one who damaged you to the point of torpor or Final Death, or if your initial death resulted from something other than taking damage. This effect\ncan be used once per game.\n\nSimply being an infernalist does not create a visible stigma on a character’s aura. A diabolist does not show taint or corruption until she utilizes an infernal power. When she does (and while that power is in effect), the character’s aura shows the clear corruption of infernal taint. Further, anyone who witnesses you use a major infernal effect will automatically notice your infernal taint whether or not they are using Auspex.\nA character can never permanently lose this merit. Demonic compacts are inviolable, and there is no way to escape a bargain once you have become part of the infernal chain of command. The only way out of such an agreement is death — and even then, the character’s soul is forever damned into the service of her diabolic master.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"},"meritType":["General"],"sourceBook":{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"yicuw1hpxsdg"}},"id":"1Xzcnrx0liSdyDzRYYQ6L7","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2021-02-18T04:09:40.151Z","updatedAt":"2021-04-06T16:50:00.830Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"sourcebook"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"bookTitle":"MET - VTM - Core Book","system":["Vampire the Masquerade"]}}},"sys":{"id":"PD6t6SDtBwmSfHGlEaawe","type":"Entry"}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"fields":{"merit":"Intense Vitality","meritCost":3,"meritDescription":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The curse of Caine runs strongly in your veins.
