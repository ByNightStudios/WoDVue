They come together in violent gatherings called rants, where they give passionate speeches, challenge rivals to personal combat, or drum up support for crusades against the status quo. They know best that the capacity for emotion can also be a dark path. Many Brujah are driven to frenzy and madness if they cannot control their passions.\r\n",{},[],"Members of the Brujah clan are Embraced from many cultures, regions, and religions.
