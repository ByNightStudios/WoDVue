Nothing is real, nothing is static, and all things can be changed through an act of will. The Ravnos call this path “Mayaparisatya,” and the path owes much to Hindu teachings. According to this arduous and demanding path, mortals follow a cycle of life and death — a cycle that has somehow eluded vampires. Due to this, the undead have lost their dharma and have no true destiny. Those vampires who ignore their dharma must be educated and enlightened — or destroyed. A vampire must penetrate the illusions of reality and see the truth beneath or she will never find salvation. This is much like accepting two conflicting truths and finding ultimate meaning in the paradox between.\n\nSystem:\nYou do not gain Beast traits when revealing a truth to someone unaware of that information, or when erasing a karmic debt.
