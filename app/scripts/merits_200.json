For example, a Bratovitch with 2 Beast traits must test for frenzy as if she had 3 Beast traits. As this is a penalty and not an actual Beast trait, it cannot be reduced or eliminated by powers or effects such as spending time with someone who has the Animal Ken skill. This penalty has no effect on Morality loss; a Bratovitch who accumulates 4 Beast traits is not considered to have 5 through this penalty.
